# CustomArduinoUNO
Made a custom arduino PCB design which is cost effective and has optimized power management
## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files for the custom Arduino board designed using KiCad software. It includes the PCB design, Gerber files, and schematic layout.

## Files Included

1. **PCB Design File**: This file contains the design of the custom Arduino board. It's in KiCad format (.kicad_pcb) and can be opened using KiCad software for further modification.

2. **Gerber Files**: Gerber files are industry-standard files used for PCB manufacturing. These files contain all the necessary information for the fabrication of the PCB. They include layers such as copper traces, solder mask, and silkscreen.

3. **Schematic Layout**: The schematic layout of the custom Arduino board is provided in KiCad format (.sch). It shows the connections and components used in the design.

## How to Use

### Viewing the PCB Design and Schematic Layout

1. Install KiCad: If you haven't already, download and install KiCad from [KiCad's official website](https://www.kicad.org/).

2. Open Files:
   - To view the PCB design, open the `.kicad_pcb` file using KiCad's PCB Layout Editor.
   - To view the schematic layout, open the `.sch` file using KiCad's Schematic Editor.

### Manufacturing the PCB

1. Gerber Files: These are the files you'll need to submit to your PCB manufacturer. Most manufacturers have instructions on their websites for uploading Gerber files.

2. Verify Design: Before sending the files for manufacturing, double-check the design to ensure all connections and components are as intended.

3. Fabrication: Upload the Gerber files to your chosen PCB manufacturer and follow their instructions for fabrication. Make sure to specify any special requirements or preferences.

### Customization

Feel free to modify the design according to your requirements. You can use KiCad to make changes to the PCB layout or schematic as needed. Remember to update the Gerber files if significant changes are made before fabrication.
